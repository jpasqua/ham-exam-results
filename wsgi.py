PythonAnywhere WSGI configuration file.

This file tells PythonAnywhere how to load the Flask app.

You do NOT run this file directly.
You do NOT need to rename your app.py to flask_app.py.

We add the project directory to sys.path and point WSGI to the Flask app
inside app.py (imported as 'application').

# Optionally set environment variable

# Import the Flask app object as 'application' for WSGI to use
